# Marksheet-result
Model is deployed on Heroku. Link - https://marksheet-result.herokuapp.com/.
The image of marksheet is processed using the OpenCV module in python.
The processed image is then converted to text using pytesseract model. 
Later the essential information is extracted through the text generated,i.e, marks of mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
The correction of words have been done to increase the accuracy.
Finally the percentage of Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics is calculated and campus selection is done accordingly.
